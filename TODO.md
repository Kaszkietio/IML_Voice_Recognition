# TODOs

#### 13.11
- Experiment with SGD
    - Learning Rate: np.logscale(-3, 0)
- Imbalanced classes


![SGD may not work with class balancing](class_weights_sgd_adam.png)

#### 10.11
- Train/test split included in preprocessing stage
- Experiment with different Neural Networks
- compare best NN to simple Convolutional Neural Network

#### 08.11
- ~~Create simple NN, setup tensorboard~~

#### Earlier
- ~~implement overlapping_frames2D~~
- ~~Split images from 'daps_img_overlap_0' into 256x256 images in dataprocessing phase.~~
- Create 'daps_img_overlap_0' with smaller resolution - around 128x128.
- Ask about out-of-core learning
